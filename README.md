Top Ten News is a web app which allows users to view the top ten news stories on any topic from the past 24 hours. 

Users are prompted at the homepage to enter a word. An API is then queried for all English-language news articles containing the specifed word in the title. This list is then narrowed to the top ten (in cases where there are more than ten items). These items are then displayed.

If the user does not type in a word, or presses the random button, a random word will be generated to query the databse with.

If there are no articles, the user is shown a message that there search produced no results.
